                        <h4>Welcome, Captain!</h4>
                        <p>Your goal in HEGGIE is to build your wealth and influence. You'll do this by choosing a career, managing businesses, trading goods, upgrading your ship, hiring crew, and completing missions. The galaxy is vast and full of opportunitiesâ€”and dangers.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Your First Choices:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> When starting a new game, you'll select a difficulty. For new players, 'Easy' or 'Medium' is recommended. 'Hardcore' mode features permadeath and is for veteran players only.</li>
                            <li><strong>Career:</strong> Your career choice is crucial. It determines your starting ship, net worth, and unlocks unique gameplay loops. Don't worry, you can change careers later, but your initial choice will shape your early game. The 'Heggie Contractor' is a great choice for players who want to experience a bit of everything.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>What to do First:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Explore the Interface:</strong> Use the navigation menu on the left to explore different sections of the game. Get familiar with your <Link href="/captain">Captain</Link> profile, <Link href="/ship">Ship</Link> management, and the <Link href="/market">Market</Link>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Earn Some Credits:</strong> Your primary goal is to increase your Net Worth. A great starting point is the <Link href="/bar">'Bar'</Link> page (or other business pages like Residence, Commerce etc.). Click the main button to generate income. Use these initial credits to purchase upgrades for the business or for your ship.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check your Quests:</strong> Visit the <Link href="/quests">Quests</Link> page. Daily quests and objectives are a fantastic way to earn large sums of credits and learn different aspects of the game.</li>
                            <li><strong>Travel and Trade:</strong> Once you have some capital, head to the <Link href="/galaxy">Galaxy</Link> map. Traveling to a new system will change market prices. Buy goods for a low price in one system and sell them for a high price in another. This is the heart of being a trader.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The universe is yours to explore. Good luck, Captain!</p>

                            <li><strong>Shipyard:</strong> Purchase new ship hulls to add to your fleet. Each ship type excels in different areas (e.g., Haulers for cargo, Vipers for combat).</li>

                        <h4>Core Trading Principles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Economic Specialization:</strong> Pay attention to a system's economy type (e.g., 'Industrial', 'Agricultural'). A system will produce goods related to its economy, meaning those goods will have high supply and low prices. Conversely, they will have high demand and high prices for goods they need to import. For example, buy 'Food Rations' cheap in an 'Agricultural' system and sell them for a large profit in an 'Industrial' system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Events:</strong> Random galactic events can drastically shift market prices. A "trade embargo" could make certain goods skyrocket in value, while a "mineral rush" could crash the price of ores. React quickly to these events to maximize your profits.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Your Portfolio:</strong> This shows all the shares you currently own and their total current value. This is the quickest way to see how your investments are performing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Market Listing:</strong> View all tradable stocks, their current price, and their recent performance. Use the search and category filters to find specific companies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dynamic Prices:</strong> Stock prices are not static. They fluctuate every few seconds and are subject to random market events like spikes and crashes. A shrewd investor watches the trends closely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trading Panel:</strong> When you select a stock, the trading panel will appear. Here you can view its price history chart and use the "Buy" and "Sell" buttons to execute trades. Use the quick-trade buttons for rapid transactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Floating Shares:</strong> If you manage to acquire full ownership of the Galactic Bank, you unlock the ability to float new shares on the market, creating your own publicly traded companies for other traders to invest in.</li>

                            <li><strong>System Info:</strong> Each system has a unique security level, economy, faction, and volatility. High-security systems are safer but may have lower profit margins. Anarchy systems are dangerous but can offer incredible rewards for the brave.</li>
                            <li><strong>Planet Map:</strong> Within each system are multiple planets. Traveling between planets consumes a small amount of fuel and can be necessary for certain missions or to find specific resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Planetary Modifiers:</strong> The type of planet you are on affects the income from your business ventures. A business on a lush 'Terrestrial' world will be more profitable than the same business on a 'Barren' rock.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opening New Routes:</strong> You can't travel to a system until a trade route is established. If no route exists, you can initiate a negotiation minigame to open one. A better score in the minigame results in a lower establishment cost.</li>

                            <li><strong>Core Gameplay:</strong> On each business page, you can click the main button to generate income manually. You can upgrade the business's level to increase this income. You can also hire bots to automate this process, generating passive income every second.</li>
                            <li><strong>Establishment & Expansion:</strong> Once you have hired the maximum number of bots, you can purchase the business 'establishment' itself. This unlocks a new set of options, allowing you to expand the business through several tiers (for a high cost), manage its market value, and seek partners.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Once you own an establishment, you can sell stakes to investment partners. This gives you a large, immediate cash injection but reduces your share of the passive income.</li>

                            <li><strong>Client Services:</strong> As a client, you can deposit and withdraw your funds. Your deposits will accrue interest over time. The bank's share price fluctuates every five minutes, simulating a real market.</li>
                            <li><strong>Path to Ownership:</strong> You can purchase shares in the bank. Owning more than 5,000 of the 10,000 total shares gives you a majority stake, allowing you to control the bank's interest rate. Be careful: higher interest rates are good for your deposits but may lower shareholder confidence and decrease the share price, while lower rates can boost the share price.</li>
                            <li><strong>Full Acquisition:</strong> Once you own all 10,000 shares, you can pay a final, large fee to nationalize the bank, converting it into your own private business venture.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bank Ownership:</strong> After acquisition, the bank becomes your most powerful business, allowing you to upgrade its infrastructure and hire financial bots for massive passive income. You will still retain your personal bank account for deposits and withdrawals.</li>

                            <li><strong>Quest Types:</strong> You will find various types of missions, including Bounties, Daily tasks, unique storyline Quests, and timed Objectives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> Timed Objectives challenge you to complete a certain number of actions (e.g., "Serve 100 patrons") within a time limit for a bonus reward. These are a great way to earn extra credits while working on your businesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Career Missions:</strong> Your chosen career will unlock unique, repeatable missions on its dedicated page. For example, a Hauler can accept transport contracts that utilize their entire fleet, not just their active ship. These missions require careful fleet management, as they have specific fuel, cargo, and hull integrity requirements.</li>
