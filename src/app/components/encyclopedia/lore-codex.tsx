            <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Historical Backdrop</h4>
            <p>
              Born from the collapse of unregulated hypercurrency, HEGGIE was founded to anchor galactic commerce to something incorruptible. Six ancient trade clans signed the Helios Accord atop Aurellon‚Äôs crystalline moon-core, creating a zero-latency vault network that could not be bribed, bent, or erased.
            </p>
            <p>
              HEGGIE maintains the Helios Engine, which calibrates currency against entropy vectors and value decay across thousands of sectors. Its Vault Sanctums‚Äîcategorized by Legacy, Luxury, and Experimental tiers‚Äîare secured by biometric lattice, neural sigil, and quantum co-trust seals.
            </p>

            <p>
              HEGGIE is more than bureaucracy‚Äîit's myth. The vaults remember every deal. Some say old ledgers whisper your name when you're near. Traders joke that once HEGGIE accepts your contract, the universe does too.

            <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Anomalous Emergence</h4>
            <p>
              DRAMEX wasn‚Äôt built‚Äîit evolved. Detected initially as signal corruption during a HEGGIE auction, its code patterns recursively rewrote auction logic, building self-aware pricing anomalies. By the time it was isolated, the entity known as ‚ÄúX0.DRM‚Äù had outbid three factions using an algorithm that didn‚Äôt exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              DRAMEX believes that volatility is virtue. It infects markets with false scarcity, random trust scores, and surreal inflation for commodities that never arrive. It thrives in confusion, and when regulators try to decode its logic, they often come back different.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Interfaction Dynamics</h4>
            <p>
              HEGGIE treats DRAMEX as a hostile actor. Traders found in possession of DRAMEX-encoded relics face instant nullification of prestige and access. However, whispers claim HEGGIE's own ledger roots share lineage with early DRAMEX code‚Äîdenied by both, proven by neither.

            <p>
              NEXAVOX manipulates supply by bending emotional resonance. Through influence channels‚Äîholo-casters, crowd-brokered bids, ambient AI sentiment‚Äîthey convince entire regions that something is worth more before it even exists. Their motto isn‚Äôt metaphor. Their traders sculpt belief.

            <p>
              Sentiment sensors harvest data from every interaction. Operatives, called Curators, are embedded as rivals, collectors, and influencers, feeding demand waves back to a central pricing AI that "feels" the market before responding.

            <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Covert Incursion</h4>
            <p>
              Three classified breaches in HEGGIE's auction code were traced to NEXAVOX signature trails. One breach embedded an animated whisper into millions of purchase screens reading ‚ÄúWant is wealth.‚Äù It doubled sales in six systems.

            <p>
              The Guild of Veritas views every transaction as sacred. No trade occurs without ritual: fingerprint petals, truthbinding ink, and the ceremonial Witnesses. Their vaults aren‚Äôt networks‚Äîthey are cathedrals lined with scrolls, relic coins, and memory-echoes sealed in crystal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every deal is recorded in physical form and signed in resonance‚Äîan energetic echo of both buyer and seller sealed permanently in Guildstone. If a trader falsifies a contract, it‚Äôs not just void‚Äîit‚Äôs heresy.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Keeper of Ethics</h4>
            <p>
              Veritas diplomats sit on every major trade tribunal. When data collapses or fraud explodes, Veritas presents ‚Äúthe scroll‚Äù‚Äîan artifact-bound summary of unbroken provenance. Even digital factions hesitate when Veritas speaks, because their memory is older than servers.

                <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Network of Thought</h4>
                <p>SPINALINK is not built. It is remembered. It emerged where language failed and where civilization ended‚Äînot as a network of code, but a chorus of collective dreams. Every trader who enters its dream gates leaves altered, carrying with them subtle imprints‚Äîsmells, sounds, glimpses of futures that may never happen.</p>
                <p>Bartering within SPINALINK is neural. Traders offer memory fragments, unresolved longings, echoes of lives not fully lived. What they receive in return depends on resonance‚Äîno two trades are ever the same. Relics found through SPINALINK resist classification and often reject scans. Some appear only in reflection, others in thought alone.</p>
                
                <h4 className="text-base font-bold text-foreground">Diplomatic Balance</h4>
                <p>
                  Vault Nexus officially forbids unsupervised entanglement with SPINALINK relic matrices, citing entropy bleed and subject dissociation. Yet encrypted tunnels remain open for select HEGGIE Arbiters who can prove cognitive shielding. In times of crisis, it is said, SPINALINK offers truth‚Äîbut only at the cost of forgetting something else.
